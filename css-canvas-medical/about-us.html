        Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable,
        intelligent tools to advance their practice of medicine &mdash; and
        improve their day-to-day.

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p>
        Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen
        dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality and efficiency
        of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers.
        Workflows are overly restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology
        partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art and science &mdash;
        technology can help or hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across
        the country, we think we have begun to build something that helps.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna &mdash;
        a family nurse practitioner &mdash; sacrifice family time in the evening
        to "finish" charting. It never ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrew knew that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. He started
        to fill the gaps in his experience. Seven practicing clinicians formed
        the clinical advisory board &mdash; rather than leave practice to work
        full-time with Canvas, they used and reviewed product changes in their
        practices. Our Medical Director, Dr. Zimmerman, joined when he saw the
        potential of Canvas to help independent practices like his practice,
        Temedscal Creek Medicine in Oakland, CA. Julian joined Canvas after
        working at Medicare and seeing the failures of current technology to keep
        up with increasing regulatory demands without burdening clinicians. Joe
        and a world class group of software developers joined to accelerate our
        ability to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improve the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting that
        completely eliminates the need for menus and pop-ups. The name of the
        company describes the charting experience &mdash; it feels like a blank
        canvas where you can tell the patient's story and seamlessly complete
        notes, orders, and chart review on a single, unified screen. With
        seamlessly integrated population health, billing, and practice management,
        Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern primary care practice.
