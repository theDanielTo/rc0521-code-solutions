          <li><span>Making the Decision To Switch</span>
            <p>
              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
              determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched
              return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as
              possible to make this determination one way of the other. We will
              provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a
              feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to
              talk about their experience.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><span>Interfaces and Community Integration</span>
            <p>
              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
              community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax
              number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting
              bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred
              specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending
              referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces
              with health information exchanges or other information technology
              vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we
              can deliver and when.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><span>Data Migration</span>
            <p>
              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
              current data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely
              hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to import
              into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like medications,
              problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While
              importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team
              has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide
              variety of EMRs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><span>Training and Site Visit</span>
            <p>
              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical
              content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will
              be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team
              members with clinical, practice management, and billing workflows.
              Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your
              practice to wokr side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><span>Go-Live and Tuning</span>
            <p>
              Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your
              practice. We will be with you, either in-person or remotely depending
              on your preference, to make sure everything goes smoothly. There is
              always fine tuning to do once you have a handful of encounters in
              Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up
              new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.
              We are here to help with it all.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><span>Sustained Performance</span>
            <p>
              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises
              and provide support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty
              means that if we are not meeint expectations, you can terminate the
              agreement and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to
              happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarentee: if
              you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone,
              we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be
              a long, productive partnership for us both.
