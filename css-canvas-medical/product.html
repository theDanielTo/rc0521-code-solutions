        Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care accross Clinicians,
        staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more productive,
        less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of
        medicine.

          Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you
          never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
          interaction, it gets smart with every patient you see.

          of opiods according to the most recent guidelines? That doesn't seem
          like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions. But I
          just couldn't get an answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years

        <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
          performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase
          revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
          capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

          ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're
          a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of
          coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely
          eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance."
